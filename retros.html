 Today, the lesson was all about learning the different console
commands in Ubuntu. These commands allow the creation of folders 
and files, alongside the deletion of them. They also allow manuals
to be opened up. For example, "mkdir" and "touch" create a folder
and file, respectively, while  "nano" allows the creation of blogs.
Inversely, "rm" removes files, while "(-rf)" removes a file by
force. Those are some  examples of console commands in Linux, and there
are still many more to use. I hope these commands will be of great 
use to me when using the Linux system.

 Today, I learned a lot more about HTML as well as the commands necessary to
 create a file that shows how the page would look on a browser.
 For example, the "h1" commands set headings, while the bracket commands are
 there to help add certain visual effects.
 There's a lot to take in, and I hope I can remember it all.

 Today, I learned about how to create a webpage, how to edit it in HTML 
and how to create a field for typing in info. I also learned how to adjust
the font if it's a custom font from a site, as well as create borders and adjust
the text to better fit the webpage. Still a lot to take in, but I'm learning 
bit by bit.
