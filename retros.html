 Today, the lesson was all about learning the different console
 commands in Ubuntu. These commands allow the creation of folders 
 and files, alongside the deletion of them. They also allow manuals
 to be opened up. For example, "mkdir" and "touch" create a folder
 and file, respectively, while  "nano" allows the creation of blogs.
 Inversely, "rm" removes files, while "(-rf)" removes a file by
 force. Those are some  examples of console commands in Linux, and there
 are still many more to use. I hope these commands will be of great 
 use to me when using the Linux system.

 Today, I learned a lot more about HTML as well as the commands necessary to
 create a file that shows how the page would look on a browser.
 For example, the "h1" commands set headings, while the bracket commands are
 there to help add certain visual effects.
 There's a lot to take in, and I hope I can remember it all.

 Today, I learned about how to create a webpage, how to edit it in HTML 
 and how to create a field for typing in info. I also learned how to adjust
 the font if it's a custom font from a site, as well as create borders and adjust
 the text to better fit the webpage. Still a lot to take in, but I'm learning 
 bit by bit.

 Today, I initiated the Bootstrap challenge, where I coded an entire page using Bootstrap
 code. I had to add fields for typing in info, add columns to the page, create a schedule, 
 etc. This was not an easy challenge, and I screwed up the code
 many times but I am only just beginning my journey to being a 
 web developer.

 Today, I learned about the basics of JavaScript, inputting various functions, and applying
 them in a basic lesson. There are a couple of various functions in .js to look out for that
 can create "true" or "false" tags. You can also use comments to keep track of these functions,
 which is helpful if you lose track of them. It's still an uphill battle from here, but I really
 do hope my skills will improve as I continue on in this class.

 For today's lesson, I learned a couple of JavaScript actions. One of these actions is a Loop, in which the action is done a couple
 of times until the condition reads as true. We are also undergoing the "foobar" challenge, in which we must insert a couple of
 commands into a .js file that count out the numbers in a way that counts the numbers as divisible by foo (3) or bar (5).
 Lastly, I learned how to create arrays, along with how to remove and add items to the array through commands like the 
 "splice" command (removes an item from a specific point in the array. Things are starting to get harder, but I hope I'll
 stick it out.

 In class today, I learned how to make a game, adjust the positioning of sprites by typing in xy coordinates,
 and changed how they interact with each other. I also learned how to adjust the variables in a 
 "const" list so that they lead to an outcome that matches depending on whether or not the 
 variable was listed as "true" or "false". While I haven't gotten the hang of adjusting the sprites to a level
 where they line up right with each other, I'm still working on it.

 Today, we did a Javascript interactive page, as well as write scripts to run with that interactive page.
 I was also able to turn in my portfolio and scratch project for today, and we have started on a new challenge.
 Today was a decent day, and I still grow more and more in terms of knowledge.

 In today's lesson, we learn the difference between Native and Host objects. Native objects include strings and arrays,
 while Host objects include windows and documents. We also take a look into Node and its basic functions, which includes
 the ability to run .js scripts outside of the browser. Can't wait to see what's in store for this week.

 Today, I learned to create a web server through Visual Studio Code/Terminal. What are we using this server for, that 
 is for a special project we have already turned in a week ago. That happens to be our portfolio, which we are showing
 off, along with a powerpoint. Lot to cram so far, but I'm still kicking.

 Today, we learned more about setting up a server for a HTML page. We also presented our portfolios to the entire class.
 I learned a little more about the students today, and my knowledge grows ever so much.

 Today in class, we begin on a new project, which is creating an API for a specific task. For the API we wanna make, it
 is a music player. Luckily, HTML5 enables the ability to create a music player and allow it to play back music in the
 browser. We also need to create a presentation to sell our program on people, so let's hope this presentation goes well.

 In today's class, we learned how to create a list using a mix of HTML, CSS, and JS. This list is not a typical list, but
 one that can be customized in terms of both appearance and contents. Tomorrow is the day of our project, and I jope it will go 
 well.
