Today, the lesson was all about learning the different console
commands in Ubuntu. These commands allow the creation of folders 
and files, alongside the deletion of them. They also allow manuals
to be opened up. For example, "mkdir" and "touch" create a folder
and file, respectively, while  "nano" allows the creation of blogs.
Inversely, "rm" removes files, while "(-rf)" removes a file by
force. Those are some  examples of console commands in Linux, and there
are still many more to use. I hope these commands will be of great 
use to me when using the Linux system.
